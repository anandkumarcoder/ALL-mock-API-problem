</head>
<body>
    <p>Here is an API: [https://otpgenerator.ishanjirety.repl.co/get-otp?name=]
        You will enter a name as input from your app and send this API a request with the name along with it
       on button click. In the response, you will get an OTP which should be shown on the screen.
        <br>
        Followup1: Make another input section that asks the user to guess the OTP and for checking whether the guess is equal to the actual one or not add a button "Validate" which on clicking shows the message "Success " or "Failure" depending.  The response is coming in the form of format something like - "ABC-57083". So compare the OTP value from the response as well as the input which is being entered.
        
        <br>
        Followup2: Change the color of validating message to GREEN when success comes up and change it to RED if failure comes up on the click of Validate Button. </p>
